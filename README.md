# AndroidCribbage
Cribbage on android I made for Marist MSCS 565 game design class
Built in the java-based Android Studio.
Project is a android studio project file.
File path to personal code is app/src/main

Play against an AI that plays the first playable card it finds.
Game implements all the functionality of the card game cribbage.
Score is automatically tallied for you.

todo: If ever return to this, try and use the Canvas to animate cards instead of the brute force method we were told to use.
Implement manual scoring and point steals.

Bugs:
When AI plays multiple cards in a row, only animates the last card.
