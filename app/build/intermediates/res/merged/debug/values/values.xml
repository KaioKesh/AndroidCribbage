    <string name="setup">
        Cribbage uses a standard deck of playing cards.
    At the start of the game, first dealer is chosen randomly and switches off every round.
    Dealer deals six cards to each person.
    Each player chooses four cards to keep and discards the remaining two to a separate hand called the crib.
    </string>
    <string name="setup_title">The setup</string>
    <string name="theplay">
        Non-dealer plays the first card and play is alternated between the two.
    Cards are played until the running total is 31 or no player can play a card that puts the total over 31.
    If one player has no valid plays, the other player must continue until they also have no valid plays.
    When neither player can play any more cards, the running total is set back to zero and play resumes with the person who did not play last.
    Round continues until both players have no more cards.
    </string>
    <string name="theplay_title">The Round Play</string>
    <string name="theshow">
        In the show both players take back their cards and score it with
        an additional card cut from the deck that counts towards both player\'s hands.
    The non-dealer scores their hand first, then the dealer, and finally the dealer scores the crib start of the round.
